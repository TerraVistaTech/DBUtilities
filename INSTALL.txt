Installation
============
Copy the files to a folder.
Add a IIS site instance, and point it to the folder where the compiled files reside.


Configuration
=============

Databases
---------
Add database connections to the Web.config file. Between where it says <connectionStrings> ... </connectionStrings>, add a line like this:

<add name="AbbotsfordConnection" connectionString="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />

Instances that are managed by SQL Express should be postfixed with their instance name, usually SQLEXPRESS, as above.
If you are using a Microsoft SQL Server (IE, not an express version), with password authentication, use something like this:

<add name="AbbotsfordConnection" connectionString="Data Source=192.168.1.20;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=AUser;Password=MyPass" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />

Make sure mixed mode authentication for that server is enabled.

Data Source should represent the server you are connecting to. All databases are accessable to this tool for backup and restore, currently.
The name of the connection (AbbotsfordConnection, in our example), can be anything, and is displayed when selecting the connection to use.
There can be more than one entry here, but the names must be unique.

Authentication
--------------
The login information can be changed at the line stating the following:

<user name="admin" password="pass" />

Directories
-----------
You can change the directory used to contain backups modifying the following snippit in Web.config:

<add key="BackupDirectory" value="C:\SQLBackups\" />
<add key="LogDirectory" value="C:\SQLBackups\Logs\" />
